## Functionality
The purpose of this program is to output a "lucky number" for a user after prompting them for their name and favorite color. The math behind the scenes is all arbitraryâ€”treat it like a fortune cookie or a Magic 8 Ball and try not to base any major decisions on it! Assuming your name and favorite color don't change, your lucky number won't either, so you only need to run the program once.

## Installation
This is a simple Python program that is interacted with through the console, so it can be run through anything that can execute a Python program with keyboard input. This includes IDEs like Eclipse, code editors like Visual Studio Code, and terminals like the Command Prompt and PowerShell. For these options, the code can be saved as a `.py` file and then run through terminal commands or, if available, a Run button.

## Contribution
To contribute to this project, begin by [forking the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). While there are many options for editing and running the program, even beyond those enumerated above, we'd recommend using a code editor like Visual Studio Code for convenience. There are currently no explicit functionalities we would like to be added to the project, but if something strikes you as a worthwhile addition, feel free to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!
